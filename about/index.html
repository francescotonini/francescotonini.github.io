However, I believe that the foundations of my career began to take shape way before I had the opportunity to touch a computer.</p><p>Throughout my childhood Legos have fueled my days.
I have always been fascinated by those tiny, simple, cubic-shaped bricks that through meticulous and simple steps became complex structures and buildings.
The sky was the limit.</p><p>Then, years went on and Legos started to fade in the background.
If only there was something else made of elementary bricks from which I can build anything.</p><p>You know where I am going.
I do not remember when I had my first <em>date</em> with a programming language<sup id=fnref:1><a href=#fn:1 class=footnote-ref role=doc-noteref>1</a></sup> but it felt like the next big thing.
Things quickly blew out and I was writing software for everything that came to my mind<sup id=fnref:2><a href=#fn:2 class=footnote-ref role=doc-noteref>2</a></sup>.
Then came graphical interfaces and with that, mobile app development.
Back then I had a Lumia 925 and I enjoyed building apps for Windows Phone.
It was a beautiful playground to improve my programming, UI, and UX skills.
I got the chance to publish some apps to the Windows Store and they got a fair bit of traction.
One was a music game where you had to guess songs from multiple options.</p><p>After the Windows Phone departure, I decided to take a break from app development and work on something
different. At the time Telegram just released their bot platform and I jumped on the train with a friend of mine, <a href=https://contrini.it>Matteo</a>. Not only did I took a break from app development,
but also from C#, the only programming language I &ldquo;really&rdquo; knew. Matteo and I started working with node.js and within some months we released two bots based on that framework: <a href=https://trackbot.it>TrackBot</a> and PriceTrackBot.
Soon enough both of them became very popular in Italy. While PriceTrackBot went offline some years ago, <a href=https://trackbot.it>TrackBot</a> is still available and does not stop getting better (and popular!).</p><p>When PriceTrackBot died, I decided to go back to my roots and start working on Android apps. Because of my
previous knowledge of C#, I started building apps with Xamarin.Android. In September 2017 my first Android
app, UniVR Orari, went online on the Play Store.</p><p>Today, my interests lie in deep learning and AI. I can&rsquo;t wait to find my next project that, just like the others, will improve my technical skills.</p><section class=footnotes role=doc-endnotes><hr><ol><li id=fn:1 role=doc-endnote><p>I just remember it was a YouTube video that walked me through how to build a basic calculator in Turbo Pascal. <a href=#fnref:1 class=footnote-backref role=doc-backlink>&#8617;&#xfe0e;</a></p></li><li id=fn:2 role=doc-endnote><p>I mean it was basic CLI stuff but for me it felt like magic. <a href=#fnref:2 class=footnote-backref role=doc-backlink>&#8617;&#xfe0e;</a></p></li></ol></section></article></section></div><footer class=footer><section class=container><p><i>I'm not superstitious, but I'm a little 'stitious.</i></p>©
